# safe-rl-human-intervention
The project is to design and evaluate a safe interactive Reinforcement Learning system where a human monitors a grid-world agent, intervenes on unsafe actions, and trains a neural safety shield to minimise safety violations while maintaining task performance and limiting intervention frequency.
